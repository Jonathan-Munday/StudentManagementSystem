# StudentManagementSystem

Project Overview
This project is a Java-based system designed to manage different types of students at a university. It supports Undergraduate Students and Graduate Students. Because students have many optional details (like scholarships or research roles), I used the Builder Design Pattern to create the objects safely and clearly.
